# preterm-FER-socialskills
This repository contains the datasets, extracted data, quality assessments, and outputs used for the meta-analysis of facial emotional recognition (FER) and social skills in preterm-born (PB) individuals compared to term-born controls.
## Files
### 1. `correlations FER and social skills.dta`
This Stata dataset contains the correlation coefficients used to assess the relationship between FER and social skills in PB individuals.
### 2. `data extraction and quality assessment.xlsx`
An Excel workbook with seven sheets containing detailed data used in the meta-analysis:
   - **Data Extraction**: Raw data extracted from included studies.
   - **Quality and Bias Assessment**: A thorough evaluation of the methodological quality and potential biases in the included studies.
   - **FER and Social Skills Correlations**: The correlation coefficients between FER and social skills for the PB and control groups.
   - **Computation of SMD (Cohen’s d) and Hedges’ g for FER**: Calculations of standardized mean differences (SMD) and Hedges' g for FER data.
   - **Computation of SMD and Hedges’ g for Social Skills**: Calculations of SMD and Hedges' g for social skills data.
   - **FER Summary with Gestational Age and Sex**: Summary of FER data including the mean gestational age and percentage of males in the PB groups, used for meta-regression.
   - **Social Skills Summary with Gestational Age and Sex**: Summary of social skills data including gestational age and sex, also used for meta-regression.
### 3. `Forest plot Hedges g FER subgroups.gph`
A graphical Stata output file containing the forest plot showing the Hedges' g effect sizes for FER, broken down by subgroups.
### 4. `Forest plot Hedges g FER.gph`
A graphical Stata output file showing the overall forest plot of Hedges' g effect sizes for FER in PB vs control groups.
### 5. `Forest plot Hedges g social skills.gph`
A graphical Stata output file showing the forest plot of Hedges' g effect sizes for social skills in PB vs. control groups.
